Preliminaries :

=>WORD PROCESSING

# INSERT(Text,position,string) :
    
    The INSERT(Text,position,string) is a function which inserts the given string in the Text at a given position . Example :

            if the text is "ABCDE" and the position is 3 and the string is "XY",
            then :
            INSERT("ABCDE",3,"XY") = "ABXYCDE".


#DELETE(Text,position,length) :
    
    The DELETE(Text,position,length) is a function that delete every word from the string from the given position until the given length . Example :

            if the text is "ABCDEFGH" and the position is 3 and the length is 4 then :
            DELETE("ABCDEFGH",3,4) = "ABGH".


#REPLACE(Text,string1,string2) :
    
    The REPLACE(Text,string1,string2) is a function which replaces the string1 pattern in Text to the given string (string2)
    Example:

            if the text is "ABCDEFGHI" and string1 is "CDEFGH" and string2 is "XYZ, then :
            REPLACE("ABCDEFGHI","CDEFGH","XYZ") = "ABXYZI" . 






=>STRING OPERATION

#CONCATENATION(string1 // string2) :
    The string1 is concatenated with string2 . Example :
            if the string1 is "ABC" and string2 is "DEF" , then :
            string1//string2 = "ABCDEF"


# INDEX (Text,string) :

    The INDEX(Text,'string') is a function which gives the starting index of the pattern in the Text,Example :

           if the text is "ABCDEFG" and the pattern is "CD" , then :
           INDEX("ABCDEFG","CD") = 3 which is the starting index of the pattern in the given Text.


#SUBSTRING(Text,position,length) :
    
    The SUBSTRING(Text,position,length) is a function which returns the substring of given length starting from given position.Example :

            if the text is "TO BE OR NOT TO BE" and position is 4 and length is 7, then :
            SUBSTRING("TO BE OR NOT TO BE",4,7) = "BE OR N".


#LENGTH(Text) :
    
    The LENGTH(Text) returns the size or the number of characters in the given Text,Example :

            if the text is "FATHER",then :
            LENGTH("FATHER") = 6.
