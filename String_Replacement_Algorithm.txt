A text (T) and two given patterns (pattern1,pattern2) are in memory. This Algorithm Replaces every occurrences of pattern1 by pattern2 in given T :

step 1. set k:=INDEX(T,pattern1).
step 2. repeat while k!=0 :
        
        a)set T:=REPLACE(T,pattern1,pattern2)
        b)set k:=INDEX(T,pattern1)

step 3. write: T
step 4. Exit.
